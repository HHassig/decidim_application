# About

This is the open-source repository for extended_family, based on [Decidim](https://github.com/decidim/decidim).

## Use

An extended family is a sort of commumnity. On this iteration of Decidim, a family can:
- Organize events (Thanksgiving, Christmans, holidays)
- Manage household chores
- Vote on evening/weekend activities
- Share photos
- Propose leadership/structural changes
- More

## Why

Built for a case-study with Platoniq to showcase installing, using, and understanding Decidim.
